# Real_Estate_Texas_Data_Analysis

The current repository was created for educational purposes only.
The goal of the project is to apply descriptive statistics tools to explore the data to get relevant insight.
In ordert to do so, I made use of basic R commands as well as other more advanced packages(such as "ggplot2", "tidyr", "dplyr", "gridExtra" etc.).
